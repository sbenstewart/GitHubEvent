# Task

## To Get Started


1. Register for an account on [github.com](https://github.com/). You’ll use GitHub for hands-on activities.
2. [Download, install and configure git](https://gist.github.com/sbenstewart/34b9629976ab85094f476b8277078208).
3. In your terminal, configure Git to recognize you:
    - `git config --global user.name “First Last"`
    - `git config --global user.email "email@example.com"`
4. Meet [Ben Stewart](https://github.com/sbenstewart)!
    - Ben will be assisting with issues you may run into and also with your pull requests (when we get there).
    - You can get Ben's help by posting a new issue in the [GitHubEvent issue section.](https://github.com/sbenstewart/GitHubEvent/issues/new)

# Basics

## Exercise-1

In your terminal, create a demo project that replicates these steps:
1. `mkdir planets` (cd into it)
2. `git init`
3. `vi readme.md` (type about the project)
4. `git add readme.md`
5. `git reset readme.md` (new command to remove files from staging area)
6. `git add readme.md` (to get it back in the staging area)
7. `git commit -m ‘added readme’`
8. Choose a Wikipedia page about a planet of your choice.
9. Copy the first paragraph about the planet, paste it into your planet.md and commit it.
10. Save and then commit. Make sure that the commit message is meaningful.
11. Create a repository in [GitHub](https://github.com/new) with the name `One-small-step`.
12. `git remote add origin <git url here>` (to add the remote).
13. `git push -u origin master` (to push your code to your repository. Note for hostellers: Use a mobile hotspot or the Anna-Wifi at SnH or the department as github is blocked at the hostels).
14. Send the link of your repository to [https://github.com/sbenstewart/GitHubEvent/issues/new](https://github.com/sbenstewart/GitHubEvent/issues/new).
15. Use your `name - completed` as the title and the link to your repository in the comment.
